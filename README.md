# OnlineChessGame
Unity+Photon+Firebase

Hi Guys, This project is an online chess game that provides the basic chess game like that but simplifys the game rules on stalemate because of my study.

This game uses 3D CG instead of traditional 2D graphic, it provides a better visualization to players via this game. And also, the players must connect to the network to run the game and keep to connect to ensure the whole process for each game.

If you master or has some experience, please build an online architecture for gameplay data transaction and authentication by yourself.
In addition, I merged so many UI in one scence that would make drawcall, hope someone to fixed them.
