# 3D OnlineChessGame
Unity+Photon Unity Network 2 (PUN2)+Firebase

Introduction
----------------------------------------------------
Hi Guys, this project is an online chess game that provides the basic chess game like that but simplifys the game rules on stalemate because of my study.

This game uses 3D CG instead of traditional 2D graphic, it provides a better visualization to players via this game. And also, the players must connect to the network to run the game and keep to connect to ensure the whole process for each game.

Tools Architecture:
1.	Unity for the game engine to implement the entity game objects and UIs, 
2.	Firebase for the networking backend APIs of user authentication, 
3.	Photon for the networking backend APIs of core gameplay.



Bugs/Issues
----------------------------------------------------
If you master or have some experience on the network development, please build an online architecture for gameplay data transaction and authentication by yourself.
In addition, I merged so many UIs in a scence that would make drawcall, hope someone to deal with it.
